Hands are shaking after dealing with this awful API for too long. I just sent this to a contact at JP Morgan Chase.\n\n-------------------\r\nHello [X],\r\n1. I'm having absolutely no luck logging in to this account to check the Order Abstraction service settings. I was able to log in once earlier this morning, but ever since I've received this frustratingly vague \"We are currently unable to complete your request\" error message (attached). I even switched IP's via a VPN, and was able to get as far as entering the below Identification Code until I got the same message. Has this account been blocked? Password incorrect? What's the issue?\n\n2. I've been researching the Order Abstraction API for hours as well, attempting to defuddle this gem of an API call response:\n\nerror=1&message=Authentication+failure....processing+stopped\n\nNOWHERE in the documentation (last updated 14 months ago) is there any reference to this^^ error or any sort of standardized error-handling description whatsoever  - unless you count the detailed error codes outlined for the Hosted Payment responses, which this Order Abstraction service completely ignores. Finally, the HTTP response status code from the Abstraction API is \"200 OK\", signaling that everything is fine and dandy, which is incorrect. The error message indicates there should be a 400-level status code response, such as 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden or at least 400 Bad Request.\n\nFrankly, I am extremely frustrated and tired of working with poorly documented, poorly designed and poorly maintained developer services which fail to follow basic methodology standardized decades ago. Error messages should be clear and descriptive, including HTTP status codes and a parseable response - preferably JSON or XML.\r\n-----\n\nThis whole piece of garbage is junk.

When auth is successful the Frontend app may receive the associated credentials for the other backends to call their respective API.
